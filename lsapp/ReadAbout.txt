Dear Responsible,
This test has been implemented using Laravel framework.

It contains two major files named 
  1.web.php as a router in MVC design pattern
  2.GeoLocIPAndWeather.php as a controller for providing 2 end-point web services whose output will be as a json


A.Before running , you would copy the content of lsapp in C:\xampp\htdocs or a proper path
if you are using xampp 

If you want to deploy it based on other solutions like dockerizing it , it will be different

B.You should run "composer install" to download all required packages .
  After this command , you will have node_modules in the root folder (lsapp)

C.You would start Apache web server.


Some example

1.http://localhost/lsapp/public/geolocation?service=api-ip
  {"ip":"142.118.154.126","geo":{"service":"api-ip","city":"Montreal","region":"Quebec","country":"Canada"}}

2.http://localhost/lsapp/public/geolocation/209.78.192.10?service=api-ip
  {"ip":"209.78.192.10","geo":{"service":"api-ip","city":"Cypress","region":"California","country":"United States"}}

3.http://localhost/lsapp/public/geolocation?service=freegeoip
  {"ip":"142.118.154.126","geo":{"service":"freegeoip","city":"undefined","region":"undefined","country":"Canada"}}

4.http://localhost/lsapp/public/weather/109.71.192.10
  {"ip":"109.71.192.10","city":"Moscow","temperature":{"current":17,"low":16,"high":18},"wind":{"speed":2,"direction":100}}



I would appreciate if you send me your opinions
Thanks so much
